    needs all the getters and setters.
    displayItems() --
    addItem() -- gainEquipment()
    removeItem() -- loseEquipment()
    getHurt() --
    feelBetter() --
    gainExperience()  will also contain logic to level up, by which I mean gain maxHP --
    seeStatus() displays all the info --
    getScore() assigns a number value to the properties, and shares it. --
